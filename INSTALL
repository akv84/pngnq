INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Check the Makefile, adjust the installation options to suit your system.
   Especially check BINDIR, MANDIR and DOCDIR these are the directories where
   the binaries, man pages and docs are put.  
   The defaults here are for my Gentoo GNU/Linux system. 
	
2. Type "make all" 

4. As root, type "make install" or do "sudo make install"

5. Enjoy. 

NOTES:
There may be warnings about strings being too long. Unless you have a really ancient 
compiler these can be safely ignored. If you really don't like warnings add --std=c99 
to the CFLAGS or get rid of --pedantic.

If you successfully build this on a system other than those listed below please 
tell me. Also tell me if it does not work.
